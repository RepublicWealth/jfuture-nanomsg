== Introduction

link:http://nanomsg.org[nanomsg] is a socket library that provides common communication patterns.
It aims to make the networking layer fast, scalable, and easy to use.

Api documentation for link:api/clojure/index.html[Clojure] and link:api/java/index.html[Java].

== Project Maturity

_jnanomsg_ is a young project and is in experimental phase.


== Install

This section covers a installation of _jnanomsg_.

=== Leiningen

The simplest way to use _jnanomsg_ on clojure project, is including it on dependency
vector of your *_project.clj_* file:

._on project.clj_
[source,clojure]
----
[jnanomsg "0.4.3"]
----


=== Maven

Also, you can use it on your java projects with maven. As first step add a clojars repository:

[source,xml]
----
<repository>
    <id>clojars.org</id>
    <url>http://clojars.org/repo</url>
</repository>
----

Following of jnanomsg package dependecy:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>jnanomsg</groupId>
    <artifactId>jnanomsg</artifactId>
    <version>0.4.3</version>
</dependency>
----


=== Gradle

If you are using gradle, this is a dependency line for gradle dsl:

[source,groovy]
----
compile "jnanomsg:jnanomsg:0.4.3"
----


=== Get the Code

_jnanomsg_ is open source and you can found the source on link:https://github.com/niwibe/jnanomsg[github].

You can clone the public repository with this command:

[source,text]
----
git clone https://github.com/niwibe/jnanomsg
----


== Supported features

=== Transports

jnanomsg supports all transports supported by their backend (nanomsg): ipc, inproc, tcp.


=== Protocols

jnanomsg intends support all protocols supported by a native nanomsg library, but currently
it only has support for this few protocols:

* pub/sub protocol
* req/rep protocol
* push/pull (pipeline) protocol
* bus protocol
* pair protocol


[NOTE]
This documentation not intends explain how works each protocol. It intends only explain
a public api of idiomatic library for java and clojure.


== User Guide for Clojure

=== Introduction

All public clojure api for work with nanomsg library is exposed under `nanomsg.core` namespace,
and it consist on only few functions: `connect!`, `bind!`, `subscribe!`, `socket`, `send!`,
`recv!`, `recv-str!`, `close!`, `terminate!` and `symbols` that are fairly self-descriptive.

Example importing `nanomsg` namespace on clojure file:

._yours/samplens.clj_
[source,clojure]
----
(ns yours.samplens
  (:require [nanomsg.core :as nn]))
----


=== Creating a socket

Let start creating a new socket and listening messages from it. This can be done with
`nanomsg.core/socket` function that creates a new socket instance and `nanomsg.core/bind!`
function that tells to socket to bind to specific endpoint.

.Example creating a `:rep` socket type and bind to unix socket endpoint.
[source, clojure]
----
(with-open [socket (nn/socket :rep)]
  (nn/bind! socket "tcp:///tmp/sock"))
----

You can done it in a single step, passing a endpoint in a third parameter to socket
constructor:

[source, clojure]
----
(with-open [socket (nn/socket :rep {:bind "tcp:///tmp/sock"})]
  (do-something socket))
----


=== Connecting to a socket

Let start connecting to existing socket. That can be done with `nanomsg.core/connect!`
function. It acts like a previously seen `bind!` function and has the same signature.

.Example creating a `:req` socket type and connects to unix socket endpoint.
[source, clojure]
----
(with-open [socket (nn/socket :req)]
  (nn/connect! socket "tcp:///tmp/sock"))
----

Also, you can done it in a single step, passing a endpoint in a third parameter to socket
constructor:

[source, clojure]
----
(with-open [socket (nn/socket :req {:connect "tcp:///tmp/sock"})]
  (do-something socket))
----

NOTE: On clojure, a socket types are represented by keywords. With this approach,
you can create any socket type with one unique function: `socket`. As you can see
on previous examples, I have used `:req` and `:rep` keywords for create respectively
_request_ and _reply_ socket types that are part of
link:http://nanomsg.org/v0.2/nn_reqrep.7.html[Req/Rep protocol]


=== Socket types

==== PubSub Sockets

This protocol has two socket types:

- _publisher_ - This socket is used to distribute messages to multiple destinations. Receive
  operation is not defined.
- _subscriber_ - Receives messages from the publisher. Only messages that the socket is subscribed
  to are received. When the socket is created there are no subscriptions and thus no messages will
  be received. Send operation is not defined on this socket.

Example of using pub/sub protocols in clojure:

._publisher.clj_
[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [sock (nn/socket :pub)]
  (nn/bind! sock "ipc:///tmp/sock")
  (dotimes [i 5]
    (nn/send! sock "test msg")))
----

._subscriber.clj_
[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [sock (nn/socket :sub)]
  (nn/connect! sock "ipc:///tmp/sock")
  (nn/subscribe! sock "test")
  (dotimes [i 5]
    (println (nn/recv sock))))
----


==== Req/Rep Sockets

This protocol is used to distribute the workload among multiple stateless workers, and it's represented
by two socket types:

- _req_ - Used to implement the client application that sends requests and receives replies.
- _rep_ - Used to implement the stateless worker that receives requests and sends replies.

NOTE: Both sockets implements read and write methods.

._rep.clj (server)_
[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [sock (nn/socket :rep)]
  (nn/bind! sock "tcp://*:6789")
  (loop []
    (nn/send! sock (nn/recv sock))
    (recur)))
----

._req.clj (client)_
[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [sock (nn/socket :req)]
  (nn/bind! sock "tcp://localhost:6789")
  (dotimes [i 5]
    (nn/send! sock (str "msg:" 1))
    (println "Received:" (nn/recv sock))))
----


==== Push/Pull Sockets.

Scalability protocol for passing tasks through a series of processing steps and it's represented
by two socket types:

- _push_ - This socket is used to send messages to a cluster of load-balanced nodes. Receive
  operation is not implemented on this socket type.
- _pull_ - This socket is used to receive a message from a cluster of nodes. Send operation is not
  implemented on this socket type.


._push.clj (server)_
[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [sock (nn/socket :push {:bind "tcp://*:6789"})]
  (doseq [name ["Foo" "Bar" "Baz"]]
    (nn/send! sock name)))
----

._pull.clj (client)_
[source,clojure]
----
(with-open [sock (nn/socket :pull {:connect "tcp://localhost:6789"})]
  (dotimes [i 3]
    (println "Hello " (nn/recv! sock))))
----


=== Non blocking sockets

jnanomsg also comes with support for non-blocking sockets, and exposes it with simple and
unopinionated callback based interface.

You can create the async socket in same way as you have created socket previously, with the exception
that you should pass the `:async` parameter with `true` as value in the third parameter to the
socket constructor.

[source, clojure]
----
(nn/socket :req {:async true})
;; #<impl$async_socket$reify__216 nanomsg.impl$async_socket$reify__216@2d50f101>
----

Later on, you can start send and/or receive data throught async sockets with the same functions
that are explained in previous examples, with a little difference: the third parameter should
be a optional callback.

Let see some examples:

.A req/rep echo server example using async socket.
[source, clojure]
----
(with-open [socket (nn/socket :rep {:async true})]
  (nn/bind! socket "tcp:///tmp/sock.sock")
  (nn/recv! socket (fn [data]
                     (nn/send! socket data))))
----

.A req/rep echo client example using async socket.
[source, clojure]
----
(with-open [socket (nn/socket :req {:async true})]
  (nn/connect! socket "tcp:///tmp/sock.sock")
  (nn/send! socket "foobar"
    (fn [receiveddata]
      (println receiveddata))))
----


== User Guide for Java

=== Introduction

Unlike in clojure, that exposes an uniform and high level api for all socket types, java api
is slightly differet. Each supported socket type is available with own type in a specific
java package.

You can see in more detailed java api on the link:api/java/index.html[javadoc].


=== Creating a socket

Let start creating a new socket and listening messages. For the below examples, we'll use a
Req/Rep socket types.

.Example creating a RepSocket and bind it to unix socket endpoint.
[source,java]
----
import nanomsg.reqrep.RepSocket;

public class Server {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final RepSocket s = new RepSocket();
        s.bind("tcp:///tmp/sock");
    }
}
----


=== Connecting to a socket

Let start connecting to existing socket. For it we'll use a ReqSocket class.

.Creating a ReqSocket intance and connect to unix socket endpoint.
[source,java]
----
import nanomsg.reqrep.ReqSocket;

public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final ReqSocket s = new ReqSocket();
        s.connect("tcp:///tmp/sock");
    }
}
----

==== PubSub Sockets

This protocol has two socket types:

- _publisher_ - This socket is used to distribute messages to multiple destinations. Receive
  operation is not defined.
- _subscriber_ - Receives messages from the publisher. Only messages that the socket is subscribed
  to are received. When the socket is created there are no subscriptions and thus no messages will
  be received. Send operation is not defined on this socket.

Example of using pub/sub protocols in java:


._Publisher.java_
[source,java]
----
import nanomsg.pubsub.PubSocket;

public class Publisher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PubSocket sock = new PubSocket();
        sock.bind("ipc:///tmp/sock");

        for(int i=0; i<5; i++) {
            sock.send("test msg");
        }

        sock.close()
    }
}
----

._Subscriber.java_
[source,java]
----
import nanomsg.pubsub.SubSocket;

public class Subscriber {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SubSocket sock = new SubSocket();
        sock.connect("ipc:///tmp/sock");
        sock.subscribe("test");

        for(int i=0; i<5; i++) {
            System.out.println(sock.recvString());
        }

        sock.close()
    }
}
----


==== Req/Rep Sockets

This protocol is used to distribute the workload among multiple stateless workers, and it's represented
by two socket types:

- _req_ - Used to implement the client application that sends requests and receives replies.
- _rep_ - Used to implement the stateless worker that receives requests and sends replies.

NOTE: Both sockets implements read and write methods.

._EchoServer.java_
[source,java]
----
import nanomsg.reqrep.RepSocket;

public class EchoServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RepSocket sock = new RepSocket();
        sock.bind("tcp://*:6789");

        while (true) {
            byte[] receivedData = sock.recvBytes();
            sock.send(receivedData);
        }

        sock.close();
    }
}
----

._EchoClient.java_
[source,java]
----
import nanomsg.reqrep.ReqSocket;

public class EchoClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReqSocket sock = new ReqSocket();
        sock.connect("tcp://localhost:6789");

        for (int i=0; i<5; i++) {
            sock.send("Hello!" + 1);
            System.out.println("Received:" + sock.recvString());
        }

        sock.close()
    }
}
----

Scalability protocol for passing tasks through a series of processing steps and it's represented
by two socket types:

- _push_ - This socket is used to send messages to a cluster of load-balanced nodes. Receive
  operation is not implemented on this socket type.
- _pull_ - This socket is used to receive a message from a cluster of nodes. Send operation is not
  implemented on this socket type.

._Dispatcher.java_
[source,java]
----
import nanomsg.pipeline.PushSocket;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Dispatcher {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PushSocket sock = new PushSocket();
        sock.bind("tcp://*:6789");

        List<String> people = new ArrayList<String>();
        people.add("Foo");
        people.add("Bar");
        people.add("Baz");

        for(int i=0; i<people.size(); ++i) {
            sock.send(people.get(i));
        }

        sock.close();
    }
}
----

._Greeter.java_
[source,java]
----
import nanomsg.pipeline.PullSocket;

public class Greeter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PullSocket sock = new PullSocket();
        sock.connect("tcp://localhost:6789");

        for (int i=0; i<3; i++) {
            System.out.println("Hello " + sock.recvString());
        }

        sock.close()
    }
}
----


=== Non blocking sockets

jnanomsg also comes with support for non-blocking sockets, and exposes it with simple and
unopinionated callback based interface.

In java, the async socket is a simple class that receives a normal socket instance as unique
argument to its constructor and exposes api for non-blocking operations.

[source,java]
----
import nanomsg.pipeline.PullSocket;
import nanomsg.async.AsyncSocket;
import nanomsg.async.IAsyncCallback;

public class Greeter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Create a normal instance of any socket type
        final PullSocket sock = new PullSocket();

        // Create a ligweight async layer around the previously
        // created pull socket.
        final AsyncSocket asyncSock = new AsyncSocket(sock);

        // Use the standard socket connect method for connect
        // to remote endpoint.
        sock.connect("tcp://localhost:6789");

        // Use the async socket instance for execute
        // send/recv operations asynchronously.
        asyncSock.recvString(new IAsyncCallback<String> {
            public void success(final String data) {
                System.out.println("Hello " + data);
            }

            public void fail(Throwable t) {
                System.out.println("Error: " + t.toString());
            }
        });
    }
}
----


== Faq

*Why the async interface in clojure uses callbacks instead of core.async?*

The callback interface is less opinionated and is a "lingua franca" for async interfaces. It not
couples you to a concrete library o concrete async api. You can easy build on top of it an interface
that works with core.async.


*How efficient is the async interface?*

Internally, jnanomsg uses a something like a eventloop called scheduler for handle the async
operations. On linux platforms, it uses system native epoll for socket multiplexing.

For systems that does not supports epoll it also comes with an inneficient "long polling" scheduler,
that should work for experimenting with it but is not recommended use of it in production. Improvements
for unsupported platforms are welcome.

*Can I bind one socket to multiple endpoints?*

Yes, you can run the bind function/method multiple times for listen in multiple endpoints.
